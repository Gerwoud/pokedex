# Pokedex CLI (Spring Shell)

This project is a command-line Pokedex application built with the Spring Shell framework.  
It provides an interactive shell where you can query and explore Pok√©mon data directly from your terminal.

---



## Running the Application

To compile and run the project, use:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Once in the shell you can start loading in the pokemon with:
```
list
```
note that this may take a while because they're all loaded in with get requests.
